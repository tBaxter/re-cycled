After the initial [Bianchi headset missteps](/posts/2021/02/nyala-oops/) things started coming together in late February and the old workhorse got some nice updates for 2021. The weather here has been pretty miserable to try to ride in, but I think it will be well prepared for riding this year.

First and foremost, the second-try [Tange Levin headset](https://amzn.to/2QrLaX3) fit, as expected, perfectly. It's not the prettiest headset around, but these things have a well-deserved reputation for being well-made and durable. The one shipped to me certainly impressed. Nice quality with a low price makes the Tange a winner, and I'd find myself buying another pretty quickly (more on that later). I picked up a [shiny alloy brake cable hanger](https://amzn.to/3lF8MDc) to match, which was much less nice. At least it's shiny and it does do what it needs to do.

As mentioned earlier, I also scored a [Brooks B17](https://amzn.to/3tUWGt8) for the Nyala, and it's looking -- and feeling -- every bit as good as expected. I treated it thoroughly with [mink oil paste](https://amzn.to/3lCuNlY) and it's already breaking in. It's my foray into Brook-land, but I think I'm going to be in the group that loves their saddles.

I neglected to mention it in the [Nyala intro](posts/2021/01/nyala-updates/), but a set of 26" [Marathon Mondial tires](https://amzn.to/3c6sMva) were a late 2020 addition. I haven't really had a chance to ride these yet, but I'm looking forward to seeing if they live up to their reputation as a great (and nearly bulletproof) all-around tire, equally comfortable on the road and trail. They're not lightweights, but early indications are that they do, in fact, do make a really good all-arounder.

The other big functional upgrade was a used Deore rear derailleur from ebay. The original Alivio unit had been a pretty solid performer, but after 25 years it was getting weak, and it always struggled with the [wide-range cassette](https://amzn.to/3vOjEDm) I fitted last year.

Other than that, I mostly just had some cosmetic upgrades. I was going for a sort of vintage Land Rover vibe, so I ran new [brown cable housing](https://amzn.to/3f2iJck) to complement the original dark green paint and Brooks saddle. I also wanted new grips, so I took some [inexpensive wrapped grips](https://amzn.to/310k8YS) and re-wrapped them with [Newbaum's Cloth Bar Tape in brown](https://amzn.to/3r7mEHl), then treated them with [Zinnser's clear shellac](https://amzn.to/3lF9pwy). They're ready for anything now.

And with that, I think it's ready to tackle anything I might throw at it this year. I hope to get it out on some single-track for the first time in a very long time. We'll see how 2021 cooperates, though.
