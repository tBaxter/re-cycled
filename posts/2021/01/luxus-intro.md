I've never been overly cursed with good sense, especially when it comes to projects. If there is a lost cause, I'll find it. If there is a hopeless case, I'll take it on.

I should have learned my lesson from the [Peugeot rebuild](/bikes/1982-peugeot-ph19-mixte/) and found a nice easy project. I should watch my local market and pay attention to what sells and what doesn't.

Did I do either of those things? Nope. I got it into my head that I wanted a vintage folding bike. 

Why? Beats me. I think I began to see old Italian Chiordas and Bianchi Nealeco's as a different sort of fun. I appreciate the cleverness of the rear stays forming a useful rack. Maybe I just wanted something to take camping.

Regardless, I read [Sheldon Brown's love letter to the Raleigh Twenty](https://sheldonbrown.com/raleigh-twenty.html), noticed it said the other european folding bikes of the era were generally much lower quality, and then I promptly went out and bought one of the lower quality examples: a Luxus Sportbike.

So what is a Luxus Sportbike? Who knows? It's labelled as being from West Germany, and per [this page](https://www.foldingcyclist.com/Klapprad-folding-bikes.html) it may have been manufactured by any number of companies at the time. It may not even have been made in West Germany at all.

Here's what we do know, so far:

* It bears some resemblance to some better-known vintage folding bikes with the way the stays loop around to form a rack, but it also appears to differ from each of them in the details.
* Luxus did make other bikes, although details (at least in English) are sparse. I have managed to find examples of road bikes, utility bikes and an interesting motocross-inspired kid's bike.
* This particular one isn't technically a folding bike. There is no hinge at the middle, so it technically collapses into two parts.
* This thing is unbelievably heavy. Somehow, this little thing weighs in at 34 pounds, about the same as the [Raleigh Sports](/bikes/raleigh-sports/) I rehabbed last year.
* The particular example I bought is in miserable shape.

Since the market for used folding bikes is nearly non-existent, of course my plan is to throw parts and money at this one. I want to pick up a kids' bike with some 20" alloy wheels, try to lighten up the weight, and just generally see if I can make this thing decent to ride. No matter what, it'll be interesting. 

So, with that in mind, I started tearing it down.

  {% figure img_path "home.jpeg" "Once I got it home I could take stock. It's filthy and the paint is in bad shape, but it's mostly complete. I was surprised neither the stem nor seatpost had seized." %}

  {% figure img_path "wired.jpeg" "Originally it was wired through the frame to run front and rear lights. The generator and front light are long gone, and I'm not sure how the wiring worked given that the frame separates." %}

  {% figure img_path "sport-72.jpeg" "The headbadge decal IDs it as a Luxus Sport 72, made in West Germany, for whatever that's worth." "vert" %}

  {% figure img_path "sportbike.jpeg" "The 'sportbike' decal on the main tube is pretty ragged. It hardly matters, since this thing needs a full respray. I am wondering if I can get Luxus decals. I haven't looked yet." "vert" %}

  {% figure img_path "rear-fender.jpeg" "The rear fender had a hard life but I think it can be straightened out and useful again. The rear light, however, appears to be a goner. I need to decide if I'm keeping the wiring." "vert" %}

  {% figure img_path "guard.jpeg" "The chainguard has surface corrosion but it's straight and can also be re-used. Honestly, all of it looks like it could be re-used, but there's no way I'm keeping those cottered cranks." %}

  {% figure img_path "rack.jpeg" "The rack really is a clever bit of design and appears very useable." %}

  {% figure img_path "forks.jpeg" "It's the same story at the forks: cosmetically a mess but all more or less solid. Even the fender looks salvageable." %}

  {% figure img_path "clamp.jpeg" "This star knob makes unclampling the two sections pretty straightforward. I think I can clean it up." %}

  {% figure img_path "seatclamp.jpeg" "The seatpost clamp uses a plastic wingnut as an early take on making a quick-release. Again, a clever detail." "vert" %}
  
  {% figure img_path "stemclamp.jpeg" "Up front another star knob is used to quickly adjust and tighten the long quill stem." "vert" %}

  {% figure img_path "unclamped.jpeg" "Unclamped, you can see the two parts are completely separate. When the wiring was in place I'm not sure how this worked: Did that tiny wire just tie the two halves together?" "vert" %}

  {% figure img_path "pump-peg.jpeg" "The pump peg is another delightful detail. I wonder what the very short pump looked like when new, and how the other end clamped onto the oversized and curved main tube." "vert" %}

  {% figure img_path "headset.jpeg" "The headset had no discernible grease, and didn't appear to have had any grease in a long, long time. That probably explains why it made graunchy, gravelly sounds. The whole headset will have to be replaced." "vert" %}


  {% figure img_path "bb.jpeg" "The bottom bracket looked no better. I was surprised the crankarm cotter came off pretty easily, but the bottom bracket looked like it was stuffed full of bog muck." "vert" %}
