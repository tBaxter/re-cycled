After pining for a celeste Bianchi for years, as luck and fate would have it a week after picking up [my project Bianchi](/posts/july-2020/the-first-bianchi/) I stumbled another amazing deal on a second one.

This one is complete and just needed a complete tune-up and re-lubing everything. Which means it will probably be back on the road before the first Bianchi. _C'est la vie._

As with the first one, I'm really not sure what the model of this one is. They're both made in Italy, and the frames look very, very similar. The first one appears to be about a half-centimeter larger, and this one has no pump peg (nor space for one). Other than those details, they look nearly identical, right down to the short-lived "red triangle" Bianchi decals.

As with the first one, I'd _love_ to know which model it is.

I regret not taking more pics from the cleaning and lubing process. I'll have to rectify that when I start to get it road-worthy.
