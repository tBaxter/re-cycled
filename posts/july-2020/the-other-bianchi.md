After pining for a celeste Bianchi for years, as luck and fate would have it a week after picking up [my project Bianchi](/posts/july-2020/the-first-bianchi/) I stumbled another amazing deal on a second one.

This one is complete and just needed a complete tune-up and re-lubing everything. Which means it will probably be back on the road before the first Bianchi. _C'est la vie._

Both Bianchis were made in Italy, and the frames look very, very similar. The first one appears to be about a half-centimeter larger, and this one has no pump peg (nor space for one). Other than those details, they look nearly identical, right down to the short-lived "red triangle" Bianchi decals.

This one is -- at least colloquially -- a "Quattro", but there is [evidence that Quattro refers to the rebranded SunTour Cyclone groupset](http://velobase.com/ViewComponent.aspx?ID=bfa80e6b-8b60-49bb-b9bc-ba8558a8d546) and it's actually a Campione Del Mondo. But then there's also evidence all Bianchis got a "Campione Del Mondo" sticker, and that's not a reference to the model, either. As with so many things wonderfully Italian, it may be better to think less on it and enjoy more.

I regret not taking more pics from the cleaning and lubing process. I'll have to rectify that when I start to get it road-worthy.
