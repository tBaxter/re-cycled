The [Principessa](/tags/principessa/) has continued to earn a spot in the stable, and over time has just seemed to impress more with each passing day. It doesn't hurt that it's such a nice looking bike, but it's also very nice to ride, especially given it's pretty humble origins. Some recent upgrades have made it even nicer.

First up, some [shiny aluminum pedals](https://amzn.to/2YxaKv1) to replace the [functional-but-dull plastic pedals](https://amzn.to/32qD6YJ) I had previously installed. Unfortunately this turned out to be a regression. The plastic Zonkie pedals may not have looked like much, but they worked well. The aluminum pedals were poorly finished and out of the box they barely turned. I spent too much time polishing and lubing them only to have them fall apart in the first month. Lesson learned. So now I've got [a new set on the way from another brand](https://amzn.to/3huofCX) and I'm hoping they're not more of the same junk. I'd happily pay up for some [MKS](https://amzn.to/3aXyGfY) but I don't want to run such a casual bike with toeclips.

The original gearing proved to be both narrower and higher than desired, making hills a real chore. Originally the bike was fitted with a eight-speed freewheel, and I wanted to put in an wider range. I found a [wide-range eight-speed freewheel](https://amzn.to/32mX9ri) that would bolt right up to the hub with about 5mm of spacers and repositioning the axle a smidge, but that produced a new problem: The dropout spacing is too narrow.

Luckily these old steel frames can be cold set -- don't try this with an aluminum or carbon frame -- so I made a simple spreader from threaded rod, bolts and washers and carefully _stretched_ the frame a bit. Problem solved!

The old-style stem-mounted shifters were also a problem. They're just not as convenient and easy-to-use as modern trigger shifters, and even worse, they kept getting bumped when going up hills. The upgrade, however, proved to be a bit tricky. First, the bike now had a relatively unusual 2x8 gearset, which most folks don't make as a shifter set. Second, like so many parts, a lot of shifters are on the forever-backlog unavailable list. In the end, I managed to get my hands on a suitable [Shimano shifter](https://amzn.to/2Er4Wfu) for the left side, but I couldn't locate a matching 8-speed shifter for the right side. I could, however, get some [cheapo Chinese shifters](https://amzn.to/2EjYR4M) that get the job done. It's not ideal, but it works.

If you look in the pic with the shifters you can also catch a glimpse the very nice [Tektro brake levers](https://amzn.to/3gw5vSp) I installed to replace the old Dia-Compe ones. The Tektros still have a nice vintage look, but have a much better feel than the old Dia-Compes, with a lot less "slop" in the lever. At the other end I picked up some unbranded-but-probably-Tektro sidepulls on eBay that also proved to be a nice upgrade. I should have cleaned the bike before snapping the pic, though.

It was already a good city cruiser, but with those upgrades it really became a charmer. We may have to keep this one for awhile.
