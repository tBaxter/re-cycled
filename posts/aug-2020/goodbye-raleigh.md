I really enjoyed [rebuilding the Raleigh Sports](/bikes/{{ bike | slug }}/) and learning so much more of the lore of these fascinating bikes and their indestructible three-speed hubs ([thank you Sheldon Brown!](https://sheldonbrown.com/retroraleighs/)) and I really liked riding it around. The upright position, the smoothness of the internal gearing, the _character_ of it. I found it thoroughly charming and I savored every minute of the restoration, especially since this particular example was so close to the brink before I brought it back.

But really, it's quite a bit too big for me, and I can't keep them all. So on the market it went. And as it turned out it went to a very nice young lady who's already an avid rider, but wanted something fun and funky for around town. The lemon yellow Raleigh seems to fill the bill perfectly, so I think it went to a good home. I hope it's good to her for a long time. Raleigh sure built them to last.
