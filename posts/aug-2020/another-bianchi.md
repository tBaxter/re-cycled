Just as the [Raleigh Sports rebuild](/tags/raleigh-sports/) was starting to wind down, I had Yet Another Bianchi roll into my life. This one is a 1980 or 1981 Bianchi Sport belonging to a friend, who has owned it since new.

The Sport was made in Japan with a relatively heavy high-tensile steel frame, so it was toward the lower end of the early '80s Bianchi line-up. Still, it's a lovely bike, with nice Tange lugs, relaxed geometry and a long, comfortable wheelbase.

While the bike had always been loved and stored indoors, it hadn't seen much of any maintenance and needed a thorough cleaning and tune-up.

Step one: disassemble and [polish up the frame and forks](https://amzn.to/33BkKql).
