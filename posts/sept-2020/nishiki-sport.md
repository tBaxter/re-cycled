Ever since I [rebuilt the Raleigh](/tags/raleigh-sports/), I've been thinking about building an updated take the classic upright sports tourer. There's a place in the world for a comfy, handsome runabout that's still relatively lightweight. Of course, the [Principessa build](/tags/principessa/) only made the urge stronger. There's a place in the world for bikes that aren't built for racers, but also aren't pigs to ride.

So when this attractive Nishiki Sport turned up, it looked like a good starting point. It had all the essentials. In particular, I was sold on the long wheelbase, relaxed geometry, good looks, mostly chro-moly frame and (if I'm being honest) low purchase price. 

This is one of the later, made-in-Taiwan Nishikis. It's not quite as nice as the earlier Japanese ones, but it's pretty workable, and the graphics worked well for my purposes.

It looked like it hadn't been ridden a whole lot, but it *had* spent a lot of time in a hot and humid garage, which presented a different set of challenges.

  {% figure img_path "cranks.jpg" "Drivetrain is pretty-typical for a bike in this price range from that era: Sugino cranks, Suntour AR II derailleurs. The steel chainrings are a disappointing. They'll clean up, but they were clearly a cost-cutting move." %}

  {% figure img_path "rear.jpg" "Suntour AR II in the rear, too. The rusty cluster and pie pan will have to go. " %}

  {% figure img_path "hub.jpg" "Malliard hubs are laced to better-than-usual Araya rims." %}

  {% figure img_path "chainstay.jpg" "As on the Principessa, the chainstay has a nice chromed protector, rather than a cheap sticker. These should come back." %}

  {% figure img_path "seat.jpg" "The original seat is still in place, and in good condition. Now, what am I going to do with a Nishiki-branded seat?" %}
